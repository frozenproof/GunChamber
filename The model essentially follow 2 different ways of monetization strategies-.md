The MMORPG model essentially follow 2 different ways of monetization strategies: 

1\. Use 2 different categories of virtual currency: in game money and real money currency.

- In game money:   
  \- Vie: a currency that can be obtained by killing monsters. Monsters always respawn in the maps, at restricted rates to avoid abusing.  
  \- Vie can be freely used to trade items between users, for certain premium items, players can use Vie to ask for help from users who have the items needed.  
  \- Global trade board with different sales channels for player made/farmed items. Npc also accept selling items directly but at a fixed price, the item is destroyed.  
    
- 3 different types of real money currencies:   
  \- Cookie dough (100 to become a cookie) which can be stacked and converted into cookies, saved with an account.  
  \- Cookies (main currency) can be used like your real money virtual currency.   
  \- Cookie crumbs ( special refunds when used cookies ), can only be turned into cookies by continuing to play. Conversion rate is   
* 1 minute and 80% of remaining crumbs if there are more than 1000 crumbs left, similar conversion rate below.  
* 1 minute and convert 100 cookie crumbs into 100 doughs.   
1. Very sneaky but make people rather buy a lot to avoid getting burned out  
2. Make the impression that eventually both bought and normal cookies are grouped together, so it's easier to strategize the banners.  
     

2\. Refund and revenues strategy: 

- Cookie doughs can be obtained for free at 10 \- 100 quantities often through live streams events, special in-game events, loyalty hours,...   
  1. Keep the engagement  
  2. Streaming allows publicity   
  3. Generous give out to help new players catch up  
  4. Allow players to meet up by setting the condition to receive doughs(complete a minigame to earn the gift, keyword at a map,...)  
  5. In game events like collabs, allow for growth


- Cookies can be obtained mostly through the cookie doughs and real money, which comes with unusually high prices ( because of psychology). 7 tiers:  
  1. 1 cookie (and 2 bonus cookies) daily at 0.5 dollar. (best deal stamp in the shopping cart, which is actually a lie because 2nd deal gives way more, but limited to weekly basis )  
     - 10 cookies (and 20 bonus cookies) always available at 8 dollars.  
  2. 5 cookies (and 8 bonus cookies) weekly at 2 dollars.  
     - 7 cookies (and 10 bonus cookies) weekly at 3 dollars.  
     - 10 cookies (and 13 bonus cookies) weekly at 6 dollars.  
  3. 300 cookies (and 450 bonus cookies) 

- Per banner is 3 cookies for a normal roll, 11 rolls is 30 cookies.   
  - Special rate up banner first roll is always 1 cookie for single roll, 15 cookies for first 11 rolls.  
  - Normal banner and special banner both have a limited range of availability.  
- For a bad banner( returning banner with low revenues), a bonus is added with the first 3 rolls are 3 cookies total, and the first 22 rolls are 22 cookies total.  
- Rate up banners:   
  - 10% base rate up for normal banners.  
  - 15% base rate up for bad banners on their return.  
  - 25% base rate up for special banners.

- Cookie crumbs come with 2 different refunding strategies, by % mean the cookie crumbs returned can be converted to the equivalence of the % of the original purchase:   
  1. Refunding at 20% for normal rate up events.  
  2. Refunding at 40% for special rate up events

1. Refunding works the same with free and bought cookies.  
2. After obtaining all rate up items from a banner for that banner, the player have 2 additional options per banner period to choose a different rate up sets of items, no combinations limit.   
3. However, rate up is reduced by 10% of the original rate up after every Change.

3\. Loyalty hours: 60 minutes for 1 cookie dough, reduced with total play time to maximum of 40 minutes each(after playing for 1k hours or has obtained 1k cookies in total, the total can be combined).

- Estimated DCU is through the roof, essentially threatening the actual game survival.   
- Unless we make profits, reliable profits over the cost of running servers.  
- Server optimization is a matter of do or die for this game.

4\. Bag limits: 3 cookies for additional spaces in the bag for each space. Base bag space is 100 total.

- A solution for players is to use the storage NPC at cities  
  1. Base free space is 30 for first storage, and need 3 cookies per 5 additional spaces in this NPC storage.   
  2. Shared storage between NPC in each city, essentially the same NPC but different textures.   
  3. Multiple storages on NPC.  
  4. Cap per NPC storage is 100 spaces.  
  5. Each new storage unlocks requires 30 cookies.  
  6. Base spaces are 10 on new storage accesses on the same NPC, and need 3 cookies to unlock 5 additional spaces.
