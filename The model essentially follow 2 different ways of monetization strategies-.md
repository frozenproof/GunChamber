## Currency System

The game implements a multi-tiered currency system to balance free-to-play and premium experiences.

### In-Game Currencies

| Currency Type | Name | Acquisition Method | Usage |
|---------------|------|-------------------|-------|
| **Free Currency** | **Vie** | • Obtained by defeating monsters<br>• Monsters respawn at controlled rates to prevent farming abuse | • Trade between players<br>• Purchase certain items<br>• Global trade board with various sales channels<br>• Sell items to NPCs (at fixed prices) |
| **Premium Currency Tier 1** | **Cookie Dough** | • Real money purchases<br>• Free rewards from events<br>• 100 dough = 1 Cookie | • Converted to Cookies<br>• Account/device-locked if no linked account |
| **Premium Currency Tier 2** | **Cookies** | • Converted from Cookie Dough<br>• Direct purchase with real money | • Main premium currency<br>• Used for gacha pulls<br>• Inventory expansion<br>• Premium features |
| **Premium Currency Tier 3** | **Cookie Crumbs** | • Refunds from gacha banners | • Can be converted back to Cookies through continued play<br>• Conversion system detailed below |

### Cookie Crumbs Conversion System

Cookie Crumbs represent a partial refund system that encourages continued play:

* **Conversion Rate**:
  * If > 1000 crumbs: 1 minute converts 80% of remaining crumbs
  * If ≤ 1000 crumbs: 1 minute converts 100 crumbs into 100 doughs

* **Strategic Benefits**:
  * Encourages bulk purchases to avoid burnout from slow conversion
  * Creates impression that purchased and converted cookies are equivalent
  * Helps players strategize gacha banner pulls
